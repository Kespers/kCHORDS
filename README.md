# kCHORDS
It's a data streaming pipeline that takes a YouTube video link and an Ultimate Guitar tabs link as input, and then performs the following operations:

1. Scraping [Ultimate Guitar Tabs](https://www.ultimate-guitar.com/)

Extracts the chords and metrics related to the tab

2. Stem separation

Split the audio track of the video in 5 stems:
- Vocals üé§
- Bass üé∏
- Piano üéπ
- Drums ü•Å
- Other üéº

3. Recommendation System

based on the song features the content-based system will recommend 5 song to play next

# Architecture
![alt text](pipeline.jpg)

It is made by the following containers:
- **Fluentd**: receives the YouTube & Ultimate Guitar links, adds a timestamp and unique ID, and sends them to Kafka.
- **Kafka**: Uses topics to queue data for Spark processing.
- **Spark**: Orchestrates data extraction, audio separation, and storage.
- **Hdfs**: Stores both the raw audio and processed stems for further analysis.
- **Spleeter**: Separate the audio file into 5 stems
- **Chords_Scraper**: Scrapes and structures guitar tabs from Ultimate Guitar Tabs
- **Logstash**: Ingests processed song data from Kafka topic "songs" into Elasticsearch.
- **Elasticsearch**: Stores and indexes song metadata, extracted tabs, and separated audio tracks.
- **Grafana**: Visualizes everything in an interactive dashboard.
